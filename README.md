## üìù Skill Assessment

### Tasks Completed

‚úÖ Built a Contact Form with client-side validation and confirmation message.

### Instructions

- See screen recording here: [soon]
- Contact form located at: /contact

## ‚ûï Additional Details

- For the **Web Developer** assessment, I implemented a **contact form** using [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) for the form state management and [`zod`](https://zod.dev/) for the schema-based validation, ensuring type-safe and scalable client-side validation.
- As no backend interaction was required, I configured a fake delay and a **mock API response** simulating an HTTP `201 Created` status, followed by a **confirmation message** upon successful submission.
